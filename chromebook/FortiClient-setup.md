FortiClient VPN
---------------

FortiClient VPN is a free VPN client from FortiNet.
We will use FortiClient to establish a split tunnel VPN to the Lab environment.
Traffic for the LAB environment will flow over the VPN tunnel, all other traffic will flow over your normal network connection.

Download the FortiClient VPN app from the Google Play store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fortinet.forticlient_vpn&hl=en_US&gl=US
