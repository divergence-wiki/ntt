FortiToken Mobile is a MFA app from FortiNet, similar to Google Authenticator or Cisco's Duo.  
We will use MFA with the FortiClient VPN to access the Lab environment.  

Here is a link to the FortiToken Mobile app on the Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fortinet.android.ftm&hl=en_US&gl=US

You will need to download and install the app on a phone or tablet.
