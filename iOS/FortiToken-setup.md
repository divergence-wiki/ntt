FortiToken Mobile is a MFA app from FortiNet, similar to Google Authenticator or Cisco's Duo.  
We will use MFA with the FortiClient VPN to access the Lab environment.  

Here is a link to the FortiToken Mobile app on the Apple App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fortitoken-mobile/id500007723

You will need to download and install the app on a phone or tablet.

Configuration
-------------

On the first day of your lab, you will receive a FTM Activation on FortiGate email. Let your instructor know if you do not see the email.

The email includes a QR code, which you can scan with your phone tablet to automatically activate and configure in token.  
Alternatively, you can manually enter the text code that is also include in the email.

Open the FortiToken Mobile app, and add a token by clicking the + sign.  
Scan the QR code for automatic configuration,  
or select Enter Manually at the bottom of the app,  
    then select FortiNet,
    and then provide any name you wish,
    and enter the text code from the email.
    
If you have trouble setting up the token, make sure to read the email instuctions, if you continue to have trouble, let your instructor know. Sometimes tokens need to be reissued.
