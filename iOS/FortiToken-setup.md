FortiToken Mobile is a MFA app from FortiNet, similar to Google Authenticator or Cisco's Duo.  
We will use MFA with the FortiClient VPN to access the Lab environment.  

Here is a link to the FortiToken Mobile app on the Apple App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fortitoken-mobile/id500007723

You will need to download and install the app on a phone or tablet.
